    "description": "A² The Show - Ep 385 Feat. Alexandra Chando  \"Alexandra Chando got her start in the entertainment industry as an actress. With over 18 years of experience on network television and film, she is no stranger to the production process. Chando first became interested in directing while filming Freeform’s “The Lying Game” where she played two roles. The long days on set gave her the opportunity to become well acquainted with the technical aspects of directing. From there, Chando began shadowing directors on network television series (FOX’s The Gifted, ABC’s Mistresses, CBS’ Scorpion), totaling over 400 on-set hours. She directed her first short, “LPM, Likes Per Minute” which was an official selection at Oscar-Qualifying HollyShorts, among other nationwide festivals. Additionally, she created, directed and produced “The Dinner Party”, an unscripted digital series. In 2019, Chando produced a short, “A Good Son”, for Suzanne Weinert, which world premiered at SXSW and was an official selection at over a dozen U.S. and International festivals. Most recently, she directed and executive produced a pilot presentation called “NSFW” alongside Executive Producer, Eric Amadio (Creator of FX’s Snowfall) and Cameron Duncan (Preacher, 13 Reasons Why) as Director of Photography, with the intention of selling it as a series, and Hear the Dark, set in 1915 following 2 women on a journey to find a missing boy. Up next for Chando is a female heist feature film set in West Texas.\"  https://www.alexandrachando.com/   A2 The Show is the most international podcast run by 3 guys on 3 different continents.
